cmake:
	Assimp include directory and library will need to be provided for cmake to build properly
	
	Resource files (shaders, .obj ect) are copied each time you run cmake to the build directory
	Meaning changes made to the files in the build directory will not be saved or tracked by git
	Please make all changes to resouce files in the resouce folder then rerun cmake
